/*
 * Find the 2 elements which are non repeating in an array
 * Reason to use bitwise operator: It makes our program faster as we are operating on bits and not on actual numbers.
 
  Explanation of the code:
  let us assume we have an array [1,2,1,2,3,4]
  Property of XOR: num ^ num = 0. 
  If we XOR all the elemnets of the array we will be left with 3 ^ 4 as 1 ^ 1 and 2 ^ 2 would give 0.
  Our task is to find num1 and num2 from the result of 3 ^ 4 = 7.
  We need to find two's complement of 7 and find the rightmost set bit. i.e. (num & (-num))
  Two's complement of 7 is 001 and hence res = 1.
  There can be 2 options when we Bitise AND this res with all the elements in our array
  1. Result will come non zero number
  2. Result will be 0.
  In the first case we will XOR our element with the first number (which is initially 0)
  In the second case we will XOR our element with the second number(which is initially 0)
  This is how we will get non repeating elements with the help of bitwise operators.
