/*
 * This class will generate the conway sequence also known as the look and say sequence.
 * To generate a member of the sequence from the previous member, read off the digits of the previous member, counting the number of digits in groups of the same digit. For example:
 *1 is read off as "one 1" or 11.
 *11 is read off as "two 1s" or 21.
 *21 is read off as "one 2, one 1" or 1211.
 *1211 is read off as "one 1, one 2, two 1s" or 111221.
 *111221 is read off as "three 1s, two 2s, one 1" or 312211.
