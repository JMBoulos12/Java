 * This is a program to check if a number is a Krishnamurthy number or not.
 * A number is a Krishnamurthy number if the sum of the factorials of the digits of the number is equal to the number itself.
 * For example, 1, 2 and 145 are Krishnamurthy numbers.
 * Krishnamurthy number is also referred to as a Strong number.
