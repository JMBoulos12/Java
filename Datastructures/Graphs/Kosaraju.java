 * Java program that implements Kosaraju Algorithm.
 
 * Kosaraju algorithm is a linear time algorithm to find the strongly connected components of a 
   directed graph, which, from here onwards will be referred by SCC. It leverages the fact that the transpose
   graph (same graph with all the edges reversed) has exactly the same SCCs as the original graph.
    
 * A graph is said to be strongly connected if every vertex is reachable from every other vertex. 
   The SCCs of a directed graph form a partition into subgraphs that are themselves strongly connected.
   Single node is always a SCC.
   
 * Example:
    0 <--- 2 -------> 3 -------- > 4 ---- > 7
    |     ^                      | ^       ^
    |    /                       |  \     /
    |   /                        |   \   /
    v  /                         v    \ /
    1                            5 --> 6 
    For the above graph, the SCC list goes as follows:
    0, 1, 2 
    3
    4, 5, 6
    7
    
    We can also see that order of the nodes in an SCC doesn't matter since they are in cycle.
    {@summary}
    
 * Kosaraju Algorithm: 
    1. Perform DFS traversal of the graph. Push node to stack before returning. This gives edges sorted by lowest finish time.
    2. Find the transpose graph by reversing the edges.
    3. Pop nodes one by one from the stack and again to DFS on the modified graph.
    The transpose graph of the above graph:
     0 ---> 2 <------- 3 <------- 4 <------ 7
    ^     /                      ^ \       /
    |    /                       |  \     /
    |   /                        |   \   /
    |  v                         |    v v
    1                            5 <--- 6 
    We can observe that this graph has the same SCC as that of original graph.
