/*
  Write a recursive function that will return the longest word in a sentence. 
  In cases where more than one word is found, return the first one.

  Examples  :
  findLongest("I will and ever will be gratefully and perpetually loving you Tesh!ðŸ˜˜") âžž "perpetually"
  findLongest("A thing of beauty is a joy forever.") âžž "forever"
  findLongest("Forgetfulness is by all means powerless!") âžž "forgetfulness"
  findLongest("The word strengths is the longest and most commonly used word with a single vowel.") âžž "strengths"
  .
  Notes :
  * Special characters and symbols don't count as part of the word.
  * Return the longest word found in lowercase letters.
  * You are expected to solve this challenge via a recursive approach.
