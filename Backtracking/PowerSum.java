/*
 * Problem Statement :
 * Find the number of ways that a given integer, N , can be expressed as the sum of the Xth powers of unique, natural numbers.
 * For example, if N=100 and X=3, we have to find all combinations of unique cubes adding up to 100. The only solution is 1^3+2^3+3^3+4^3.
 * Therefore output will be 1.
