  Instructions
  The classical introductory exercise. Just say "Hello, World!".

  "Hello, World!" is the traditional first program for beginning programming in a new language or environment.

  The objectives are simple:

  * Write a function that returns the string "Hello, World!".
  * Run the test suite and make sure that it succeeds.
  * Submit your solution and check it at the website.
  
  If everything goes well, you will be ready to fetch your first real exercise.

  Since this is your first Java exercise, we've included a detailed Tutorial that guides you through your solution. Check it out for tips and assistance!

  * Introduction
  * Exercise Structure
  * Solving "Hello, World!"
  * Step 1: Fix the solution
  * Step 2: Run the tests
  * Step 3: Submitting your first iteration
  * Next steps
  
  Welcome to the first exercise on the Java track!

  This document is a step-by-step guide to solving this exercise. The instructions should work equally well on Windows, macOS and Linux.

  Even if you are already familiar with Java basics, stepping through this guide may be helpful as it will help you understand the output from the tool, 
  Gradle, that we use to compile and test our code, as well as introduce some of the patterns common to all exercises in this track.

  When you fetch a new Java exercise, you will receive:

  one or more test files (always). These live in the src/test/java directory 
  and define a set of tests that our solution must satisfy before we can safely declare that it is working.
  one or more starter files (initially). 
  If provided, these live in the src/main/java directory and define shells of the classes you will need in order to solve the current problem.
  
  Output  :
  Hello, World!

// Your First Program

class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!"); 
    }
